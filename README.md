# Launch Calculator #
 
 This project includes library of tools and equations that help calculate various features about rockets and other flying bodies.
 
## Features ##
 
 * Gravity at altitude
 * Required lift given air density
 * Burn-out altitude calculation
 * Vertical coasting calculation (burnout + coasting = total altitude)
